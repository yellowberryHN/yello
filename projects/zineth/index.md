Zineth Community Edition is a fan-made mod for [Zineth](https://zinethgame-blog.tumblr.com),
a game by [Arcane Kids](https://arcanekids.com). it aims to expand upon the ideas present in the
original game, add new features, complete unfinished features, and polish the gameplay experience,
all while staying true to the games original aesthetics.

i have been working on this mod for about 2 years on and off, and i am finally ready to release it
to the public! to those of you who have been patiently waiting for this day, thank you for your support!

### note

this project could not have been possible without the efforts of the Arcane Kids, thank you!
this has not been officially sanctioned by them, and it almost feels out of character
to ask for permission, for some reason i just can't put my finger on.

that being said, if one of you discover this project and like it, i'd love to hear about it!

please reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/yellowberry__) or [any of my other lines](/)!
